## Stock Market Data Analysis with R
https://github.com/albugrimenko/R/tree/master/StockMarketAnalysis_Jan2015

In this project I want to analyze relationship between technical indicators, such as moving averages and MACD, and makret price of a stock. In other words, I want to validate the premise that future price of a stock can be predicted by technical indicators. In particular, Iâ€™m interested to discover a correlation between technical indicators and a short term (1-2 weeks) price moves.
